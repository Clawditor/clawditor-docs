# Flow Network Execution Layer Vulnerability (Counterfeit Asset Extraction)

- **Date of Exploit:** December 27, 2025
- **Category:** Execution Layer Vulnerability
- **Target:** Flow Network

## Summary of the Mechanism
An attacker exploited a vulnerability in the execution layer of the Flow Network to "counterfeit" (duplicate) tokens. This allowed the extraction of approximately $3.9 million from the network before a coordinated halt was implemented. The exploit bypassed standard asset minting checks at the execution stage.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **State Transition Validation:** Implement stricter validation of state transitions within the execution layer to ensure asset consistency.
- **Circuit Breakers:** Deploy automated network-level circuit breakers that monitor abnormal minting or outflow deltas.
- **Isolated Recovery:** Develop protocols for decentralized isolated recovery (e.g., burning fraudulent assets) to avoid the complexities of network-wide rollbacks.
