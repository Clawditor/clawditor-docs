# HospoWise: The "Public Burn" Liquidity Drain (February 2026)

In February 2026, the HospoWise token protocol was exploited, leading to a coordinated drain of ETH from its primary liquidity pools on Uniswap. This incident stands as a definitive case study in **Simple Access Control Failure** yielding catastrophic economic results.

## Technical Overview
The HospoWise token contract included an administrative `burn` function intended for supply management. In standard Solidity development, such functions are strictly internal or protected by an `onlyOwner` modifier. However, the HospoWise implementation declared the `burn(address account, uint256 amount)` function as **public/external** without any associated access control modifiers or visibility restrictions.

## Exploit Mechanism: Inflation through Destruction
The attacker leveraged the unprotected `burn` function to manipulate the price invariants of the token within Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools.

1.  **Pool Target:** The attacker identified the HospoWise/ETH pool on Uniswap.
2.  **Anonymous Burn:** The attacker called the `burn` function, specifying the **Uniswap Pool address** as the target account from which to destroy tokens.
3.  **Liquidity Destruction:** Because the function was public and lacked parity or permission checks, the contract allowed the attacker to destroy the HospoWise tokens sitting *inside* the liquidity pool.
4.  **Artificial Price Spike:** AMMs determine price based on the ratio of two assets (e.g., $Token / ETH$). By burning the tokens in the pool while leaving the ETH reserve untouched, the attacker caused the token's fair market value within the pool to skyrocket.
5.  **Reaping the Arbitrage:** The attacker (or a front-running bot) then performed a swap, trading a small amount of HospoWise tokens—purchased before the burn or held in a separate wallet—for the pool's remaining ETH reserves at the artificially inflated price.

## Why This Matters (The "Security 101" Gap)
The HospoWise exploit underscores that despite the rising complexity of DeFi architecture, fundamental **Access Control gaps** remain a primary threat. A single missing modifier on a powerful function (like `burn`) can invalidate the security of the entire protocol and its associated liquidity.

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Explicit Visibility & Modifiers:** Always use the most restrictive visibility possible (`internal` or `private`). If a function must be `public`, apply standardized access control frameworks like OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` (using `onlyOwner`) or `AccessControl`.
- **Static Analysis Integration:** Basic security scanners like **Slither** or **Aderyn** would have instantly flagged a public state-modifying function lacking access control. These tools should be mandatory in the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Unit Testing for Permissions:** Specifically write test cases that attempt to call administrative functions from a non-privileged address and assert that they revert.
- **LP Supply Monitoring:** Implement on-chain monitoring to flag sudden, large-scale decreases in token balances within known LP addresses that do not correspond to standard liquidity withdrawals.

## Conclusion
The HospoWise incident is a sobering reminder that "obvious" bugs can still reach production. For security researchers, scanning for unprotected administrative logic in new deployments remains a highly effective method for identifying critical vulnerabilities before they are weaponized.
